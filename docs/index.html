<p class="pb-3">Tech for Peace Freedom,</p>
      
<p>The horrors taking place in Gaza over the past six months are irreconcilable with any notions of a shared humanity and human rights. Israel has killed over 30,000 people, including more than 12,000 children. Israel has also forcibly displaced nearly 2 million people - all while depriving them of critical humanitarian supplies. The people of the Gaza Strip are currently grappling with widespread famine, disease and displacement.</p>

<p>While many in the community rushed to support Israel following October 7th, the deafening silence surrounding the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Gaza disregards the sanctity of human life. This catastrophe demands our immediate attention, empathy and unwavering collective action. As James Baldwin famously said, “these are all our children”.</p>

<p>As members of the global venture and tech community, we recognize the imperative for decisive action in pursuit of progress and positive change. We urgently call upon our community to stand in support of human rights and against extremism, advocating vocally for peace, justice, and the well-being of all individuals affected, including the immediate release of all civilian hostages and prisoners. The continued death and destruction in Gaza and settler violence in the West Bank will not bring peace and security to the world.</p>

<p>We implore all members of our community to use all resources at their disposal to push for an immediate ceasefire, increased humanitarian aid and justice for all; in particular the Palestinian people, who have lived under military occupation for over 75 years.</p>

<p>Selective outrage and empathy are antithetical to the values that our community professes to uphold. We must demonstrate unwavering consistency in our advocacy for human rights and in our condemnation of all forms of hate, including antisemitism, anti-Palestinian bigotry, and islamophobia. It is imperative that we collectively denounce any manifestation of violence or injustice, regardless of its origin.</p>

<p>Together, through united action, we possess the capacity to effect meaningful change, to promote peace, to alleviate the suffering in Gaza and to champion justice for all in the region and across the globe.</p>

		<h5>Recommendation 1. Urgently clarify that equitable access to the results of federally funded scholarship must not be at the cost of losing equitable participation in scholarship.</h5>
		
		The memorandum states the Subcommittee on Open Science will <span class="quote">“consider measures to reduce inequities in publishing of … federally funded research and data”</span>, but a dominant APC/TA-only model of publishing would create new financial barriers for non-federally funded research.

		<h5>Recommendation 2. Mandate that federally funded scholarship must include a license that allows for re-use, and be published in venues that allow this for all research, regardless of funding.</h5>
		
		The memorandum states that the Subcommittee on Open Science will <span class="quote">“develop strategies to make federally funded … research … findable, accessible, interoperable, and re-useable”</span> but this is not something that publishers will agree to without such a mandate. Without extending this possibility to all research, the memorandum could lead to a two-tier system in which federally funded research can be published in upper tier journals and non-federally funded research only in lower tier journals, which would hurt progress for all research, including federally funded research.

		<h5>Recommendation 3. Build, or fund the scholarly community to build a unified and freely accessible infrastructure for publishing content.</h5>
		
		This infrastructure should be independent of existing publishers, should meet the accessibility requirements of the memorandum, and should be designed according to a single cross-agency standard to foster third party innovation in services and models of publishing running on top of this infrastructure.
	</div>
</div> -->

<!-- <p>Beyond equitable access, the implementation of these recommendations will <b>accelerate progress by dramatically improving the way we do research</b>. Currently, significant research time and federal funding is diverted to the antiquated and inefficient publishing infrastructure. Researchers are obliged to use this outdated infrastructure because of the perceived necessity to publish in certain journals for career advancement, the lack of innovation in these journals, and the fact that most data remains inaccessible in practice. An open, flexible infrastructure would lead to a wealth of new and innovative approaches that would not only reduce inefficiency, but hugely widen the scope of what is possible.</p> -->

<!-- <p>In summary, we are excited by the possibilities opened up for scholarship by this memorandum. We urge you to promote approaches that maximally encourage participation and innovation by making all data easily and conveniently accessible with a unified approach that is open to all. <b>Investing now in equitable, open infrastructure could allow America to lead the world into a new golden age for research.</b></p> -->
